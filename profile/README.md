# Philosophy

The word minimalism originates in art where it means reduction of all elements to the absolute minimum.

It is however commonly used to describe something as simple and reductionist/essentialist in nature. 

Similarly projects created by `@the-minimal` are hyper-focused on one single feature.

They are meant to be combined together to create more complex and less focused systems.

This philosophy is akin to UNIX or Suckless.
